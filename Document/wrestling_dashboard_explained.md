# üèãÔ∏è Wrestling Performance Intelligence Platform

### The Problem

Wrestlers face three constant challenges:

- **Making weight** safely and on schedule.
- **Maximizing performance** through strength, power, and conditioning.
- **Managing recovery** to be at peak readiness on match day.

Currently, data is fragmented: lab tests, supplements, training logs, and recovery insights are scattered across multiple tools. Athletes and coaches lack a unified system that connects all of this into **clear, actionable daily guidance**. The result is inconsistent performance, risky weight cuts, and lost competitive edge.

### Our Solution

The **Wrestling Performance Intelligence Platform** centralizes all health, supplement, bodybuilding, recovery, and performance data into one AI-driven system. It not only tracks but **analyzes and recommends daily actions** to ensure athletes hit weight safely, build the right strength and power, and step on the mat at peak form.

---

#### 2. **Body Composition & Muscle Metrics**

Assess physical readiness and track changes through training phases.

- Body weight (daily / weekly trend).
- Body fat % and lean mass.
- Skeletal muscle mass.
- Muscle group development (upper body, lower body, core).
- Balance metrics: left vs. right symmetry, push vs. pull ratios.
- Phase alignment: bulking, cutting, maintenance.

---

#### 3. **Supplement Intelligence**

Track, optimize, and measure supplement intake vs. results.

- Intake logs (daily dosage, timing).
- Adherence % (days on-target / days tracked).
- Core supplements: Creatine, Protein, Beta-Alanine, Omega-3, Vitamins, Minerals.
- Timing optimization (pre-workout, post-workout, recovery).
- Correlation with performance scores (strength, endurance, recovery).
- ROI metrics: cost/day, cost/benefit of supplement stack.

---

#### 4. **Interactive Goals & Daily Recommendations**

Personalized guidance, updated daily.

- Weight goal targets (e.g., cut to 74kg in 3 weeks).
- Training cycle goals (strength gain, hypertrophy, endurance).
- Recovery goals (resting HR, inflammation reduction).
- Daily ‚ÄúWhat To Do‚Äù actions: supplement timing, hydration targets, nutrition focus, recovery adjustments.
- Adaptive nudges: based on yesterday‚Äôs performance and today‚Äôs readiness score.

---

#### 5. **AI-Powered Bodybuilding Programs**

Custom hypertrophy and strength plans matched to athlete data.

- Phase-based programming (cutting vs. bulking).
- Technique-specific muscle tracking (e.g., legs for shots, grip for clinch, core for control).
- Weak-point training: targeted plans for underdeveloped or imbalanced muscles.
- Progression tracking: volume, load, frequency, recovery windows.
- Muscle balance scoring: symmetry, proportional development, and injury risk indicators.

---

#### 6. **Recovery Tracking & Match-Day Optimization**

Monitor recovery and readiness in real time.

- Inflammation markers (CRP, ESR, IL-6).
- Sleep quality and duration.
- Hydration volume and urine-specific gravity.
- Training load (volume, intensity, fatigue index).
- Recovery index (AI score combining biomarkers, sleep, and soreness).
- Readiness forecast: tapering and peaking guidance to ensure competition-day performance.

---
